# SpookyTextAdventure
My first java game, a text adventure horror game. 



INSTRUCTIONS:

Welcome to your spooky adventure~

The game is simple; continue moving forward, stay alive, and you can win eventually. 

At every step in the road, you will have a decision to make; type in your option to decide your path. 

You do NOT need to type in the option completely; just the first one or two words will suffice. 

If what you type is invalid, the game will not progress. 

Keep in mind, there may be hidden options available for you to type. 

There are ten bad endings and two good endings. Try to find them all! 

Be brave, but not foolish.

Can you survive the night?
